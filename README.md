Anti-Theft-Alarm-IoT
IoT Project - Building an interactive Anti Theft Alarm for lockers (Home security)

What is this project about ?
The Anti-theft system along with fire alarm is an IOT project to protect our important belongings from being stolen. It adds additional security to homes, banks, lockers. Our main focus here is to build a home security alarm.

Objective-
It is to provide home safety and detect burglary.
They provide protection against fire and such threats.
We will be mainly focusing on designing a fire alarm and burglary detection by giving an alarm and turning on the lights whenever it encounters a rise in temperature and motion in its vicinity.
There will be a motion sensor and DHT11 for detecting motion and temperature. We take the password of the locker through the serial monitor at the entry.
If the password is correct then we do not activate any buzzer or alarm.
If the password is incorrect or there has been no input and we detect a motion, then we activate buzzers and lights to indicate an attempt of theft.
If the temperature of the locker exceeds a certain amount, then we give a buzzer to indicate fire.


Functionalities-
